## Touch-control art and screen detection: MostWanted-Android

The touch-control button art in `android/app/src/main/assets/touch/` (the button faces with their A / B / X / Y / L / R badges,
the arrows, START, BACK, the respot arrow and the steering wheel) comes from
[RanggaCasper/MostWanted-Android](https://github.com/RanggaCasper/MostWanted-Android). That project credits **bagasromadon**
for the button design. The idea of switching the on-screen controls by reading the game's own front-end (FEng) screens, and the
layouts of the menu and race controls, follow that project too. It is MIT licensed:
